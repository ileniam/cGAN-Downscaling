# cGAN-Downscaling
cGAN-Downscaling is a model based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) structure, specifically designed for statistical climate downscaling. It produces ERA5-DownGAN dataset, high-resolution (~2.2 km) daily 2m temperature and precipitation datasets for the Italian Peninsula from ERA5 (~31 km), offering low computational costs and flexible adaptability.
# Installation
To run cGAN-Downscaling Model is sufficient to clone cGAN environment and run the scripts.
git clone https://github.com/ileniam/cGAN-Downscaling.git
cd cGAN-Downscaling
make install
